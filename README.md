The __pyswarm__ package is a gradient-free, evolutionary optimization package 
for python that supports constraints.

This version is a fork of the orignal module from [tisimst](https://github.com/tisimst/pyswarm)

# What's New in this fork?

- Class object approach
- Possibility to get all the results of the convergence phase
- Add a third option for parallelism in order to let the user to deal with it
- Hot start for the initial position of particles
- Python logger
